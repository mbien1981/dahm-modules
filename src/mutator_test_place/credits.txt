List of changes:
- Steam stat publishing and in-game challenge progression is disabled.
- The mod now behaves as a mutator instead of completely overriding Panic Room when playing single player.
- The mission is now properly disabled using DAHM's script manager instead of overriding mission element methods.
- The 'quick hands' challenge and achievement no longer counts as completed while playing with the mod enabled.
- Decoration units have been removed from the roof.
- Previously spawned enemies will be deleted when activating the enemy spawner again.
- Previously spawned bags will be deleted when activating the bag spawner again.
- The weapon spawner has been repositioned and now you are able to interact with the spawned gun in order to equip it.
- Added a 'Test' button that will run a user defined script in util.lua
- Added partial multiplayer support.
